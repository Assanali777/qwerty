            <p><h1>Tips for Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle During Social Distancing and Work from Home</h1>At this extreme moment, we began working from home, away from campus, and keeping social distance for as many
                people as possible. As we stay home and are stuck with the foods that have been in our fridge or pantry for a while,
                we are temporarily living a sedentary lifestyle with increased odds of physical inactivity, excessive eating and sitting,
                stress, anxiety, and depression. In particular, many of us will gain some weight during the pandemic and may keep the
                extra weight permanently, which may carry considerable health risks for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart attack,
                stroke, and other health problems.
                Here, I’d like to share some basic tips and resources for how to maintain your healthy lifestyle, body weight, and
                overall well-being while staying home and engaging in social distancing.

 <section><h2>What is a healthy lifestyle, exactly?</h2><p>These five areas were chosen because prior studies have shown them to have a large impact on risk of premature death. Here is how these healthy habits were defined and measured:
              
  1.   Healthy diet, which was calculated and rated based on the reported intake of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids, and unhealthy foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium.2.  Healthy physical activity level, which was measured as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity daily.

  3.   Healthy body weight, defined as a normal body mass index (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 24.9.
  
  4.   Smoking, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. "Healthy" here meant never having smoked.
  
  5.   Moderate alcohol intake, which was measured as between 5 and 15 grams per day for women, and 5 to 30 grams per day for men. Generally, one drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol. That’s 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.
  
  Researchers also looked at data on age, ethnicity, and medication use, as well as comparison data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center"> Health</h2>
        <p>Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
           The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race,
           religion, political belief, economic or social condition.The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace
           and security and is dependent on the fullest co-operation of individuals and States.
           The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all.</p>
