            <p>The Healthy Food for Life resources are for the entire population over the age of five and they define the Irish Government recommendations on healthy eating and a balanced diet.  They provide a consistent and evidence-based approach for healthy eating advice.

                The guidelines and resources provide practical support for individuals and families to make healthier food choices and to ultimately improve their health and wellbeing. They include a leaflet, infographic of the food pyramid, sample daily meal plans, guidelines on portion sizes and fact sheets.
                
                 The key messages from Healthy Food for Life are:
                
                Eat more vegetables, salad and fruit - Up to seven servings a day
                Limit intake of high fat, sugar, salt (HFSS) food and drinks 
                Size matters: Use the food pyramid as a guide for serving sizes
                Increase your physical activity levels
                Small changes can make a big difference. Start TODAY!
